- ## ðŸ¤” Why Java instead of Kotlin?

While Kotlin is the modern standard for Android development, I chose to use Java in this project for the following reasons:

- ðŸ§  I have a strong foundation in Java, which allows me to focus more on app architecture, problem-solving, and clean implementation under tight timelines.
- ðŸŽ¯ I believe that if someone understands core Java concepts deeply, it becomes easier to learn and transition into other languages, including Kotlin.
- ðŸ’¬ This project is also a way for me to showcase my knowledge of Java fundamentals â€” including OOP, collections, and design patterns â€” in the context of Android development.
- ðŸ”„ I am actively learning Kotlin and already familiar with its syntax and capabilities, but chose Java here to demonstrate technical depth in a language Iâ€™m confident with.

Iâ€™m fully comfortable working with both Java and Kotlin, and open to using whichever best fits the team or project needs.
